Farlin understands how parents can find these midnight tussles absolutely stressful and has created a very practical pacifier that can make life so much simpler. The Farlin Orthodontic - Glow in the Dark pacifier glows in the dark and allows you to find the pacifier in the jiffy and calm your baby in no time. The pacifier renders orthodontic advantages as well. Made from high quality silicone this firm and flexible pacifier promotes the natural development of your baby’s palate, teeth and gums. The pacifier is soft and easy to suck and reduces pressure on the jaw during sucking. The bulb of the teat is designed to allow proper tongue placement during sucking. The glow-in-the-dark pacifier from Farlin is suitable for babies aged 6 to 8 months. The pacifier is durable and maintains its shape even after long use. The shield of the pacifier has ventilation holes to allow the circulation of air and also has a swivel ring that allows you to take the pacifier out of your baby’s mouth with ease. Now you can enjoy peace and quiet while you put your baby to bed or prepare their bottle and your baby enjoys soothing comfort with the Farlin Orthodontic pacifier.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/teether-soother/x/h/x/farlin-orthodontic-glow-in-dark-200x200-imadaqrwc2fuzjpe.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/teether-soother/x/h/x/farlin-orthodontic-glow-in-dark-400x400-imadaqrwc2fuzjpe.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/teether-soother/x/h/x/farlin-orthodontic-glow-in-dark-800x800-imadaqrwc2fuzjpe.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/teether-soother/x/h/x/farlin-orthodontic-glow-in-dark-original-imadaqrwc2fuzjpe.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[TSODADJT8AUGNXHX]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":210.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":210.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":210.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/farlin-orthodontic-glow-dark-soother/p/itmdgeb7zvn7rzzq?pid=TSODADJT8AUGNXHX&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"Farlin","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0.0,"offers":[],"categoryPath":"Baby Care>Health & Safety>Teethers & Soothers","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"OliveTreeRetail","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Type","value":["Soother"]},{"key":"Ideal For","value":["Boys, Girls"]},{"key":"Age Group","value":["6 - 8 Months"]},{"key":"Material","value":["Silicone"]}]},{"key":"Additional Features","values":[{"key":"Other Features","value":["Promotes Oral Development, Reduces Jaw Pressure, Bulb Promotes Tongue Placement, Glows in the Dark, Unchangeable Shape and Boilable, Firm and Flexible, Convenient for Night Use"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":null,"binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":null,"year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":["Boys","Girls"]}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"TSODFZNZRWBUGVMU","title":"Farlin Cooling Gum Soother Soother","productDescription":"\"Distilled Water Filled- Cooling Gum Soothers(BF 14501)\"Relieves discomfort during teething.

Make this rite of passage a little easier on your 8 month old baby with the Silicone Pacifier Step 3 from Pigeon. Protective Hood The pacifier features a protective hood which covers the nipple and shields it from the accumulation of dust particles. Breather Holes on Shield The breather holes on the shield ensure that however small the baby’s face may be, the child will always be able to breath in and out easily. Snug-fitting Shield This shield offers a snug fit over the mouth of a teething baby and conforms to international safety standards. Stabilizing and Calming Effect on Baby The sucking reflex action helps activate the brain and provides a psychological stabilizing effect that calms the baby. This is why whenever you place a pacifier in a crying baby’s mouth, the child will immediately stop wailing. Babies Natural Sucking Reflex Action The pacifier features a soft tip underneath and a firm tip on top, both of which facilitate the baby’s natural sucking reflex action. Promotes Nasal Breathing The pacifier helps the child breath from the nose instead of from the mouth, which helps develop their tiny lungs. Develops Healthy Teeth The pacifier features a thin lip cotact which helps promote the healthy development of the baby’s teeth.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/teether-soother/a/v/v/pigeon-cherry-silicone-pacifier-step-3-200x200-imadj8bz5t5gpdq3.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/teether-soother/a/v/v/pigeon-cherry-silicone-pacifier-step-3-400x400-imadj8bz5t5gpdq3.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/teether-soother/a/v/v/pigeon-cherry-silicone-pacifier-step-3-800x800-imadj8bz5t5gpdq3.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/teether-soother/a/v/v/pigeon-cherry-silicone-pacifier-step-3-original-imadj8bz5t5gpdq3.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[TSODADJTCB76VAVV]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":160.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":160.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":160.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/pigeon-pacifier-step-3-cheery-bpa-free/p/itmdbdyyhvzggnxt?pid=TSODADJTCB76VAVV&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"Pigeon","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0.0,"offers":["Extra 15% off* with digibank by DBS"],"categoryPath":"Baby Care>Health & Safety>Teethers & Soothers","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":100.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Sat Sep 10 23:59:59 IST 2016 -

In this game, each player has to choose his/her racing marble color and place it in the starting gate. They can then twist the starter and watch the marbles slide through the track, spin around the dish after entering each vortex and arrive at the podium. The player whose marble arrives first at the podium is declared the winner.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/block-construction/r/a/2/galt-marble-racer-200x200-imadz3fshthuebwa.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/block-construction/r/a/2/galt-marble-racer-400x400-imadz3fshthuebwa.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/block-construction/r/a/2/galt-marble-racer-800x800-imadz3fshthuebwa.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/block-construction/r/a/2/galt-marble-racer-original-imadz3fshthuebwa.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[BLCDYZ7DMD3PGRA2]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":4455.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":2765.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":2765.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/galt-marble-racer/p/itmdyz7danymkvqt?pid=BLCDYZ7DMD3PGRA2&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"Galt","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":37.0,"offers":[],"categoryPath":"Toys>Educational Toys>Blocks & Constructions","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"ARYSS","sellerAverageRating":2.5,"sellerNoOfRatings":2,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Skillset:Hand & Eye Co-ordination, Problem Solving, Creativity & Imagination","Non Battery Operated","Age Group: 48 month 96 month","Type: Stackers & Sorters"],"detailedSpecs":["Skillset:Hand & Eye Co-ordination, Problem Solving, Creativity & Imagination","Non Battery Operated","Age Group: 48 month 96 month","Type: Stackers & Sorters"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Sales Package","value":["Starter top, Starter base, Finish, 3 Racing vortex, 1 Wiggly bell chute, Staircase, Staircase support, 1 Curved chute with horizontal wheel, 1 Vertical wheel chute, 1 Paddle wheel, 'S' shaped Chute, 4 straight Chutes, 37 Tubes, 4 Bases, 20 Marbles"]},{"key":"Series","value":["Blocks-n-Marbles"]},{"key":"Age Group","value":["4 -
