The spectators of this film are shown how they can actively use this secret so as to uplift their lives.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/r/z/k/the-secret-200x200-imadthzczxtgwa66.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/r/z/k/the-secret-400x400-imadthzczxtgwa66.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/r/z/k/the-secret-800x800-imadthzczxtgwa66.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/r/z/k/the-secret-original-imadthzczxtgwa66.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[AVMD85DKZ6DN4RZK]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":699.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":550.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":550.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/secret-english-tamil/p/itmdjsgwz7xmq7js?pid=AVMD85DKZ6DN4RZK&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":21.0,"offers":["Extra 15% off* with digibank by DBS"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":70.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Sat Sep 10 23:59:59 IST 2016 - Sun Sep 11 23:59:59 IST 2016 days.","sellerName":"VIDEOJUNCTION","sellerAverageRating":4.0851064,"sellerNoOfRatings":94,"sellerNoOfReviews":2},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Moserbear"]},{"key":"Title","value":["The Secret - English And Tamil"]},{"key":"Format","value":["DVD"]},{"key":"Language","value":["Tamil"]},{"key":"Year of Release","value":["2006"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"Tamil","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Moserbear","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVME9CGYZFP5DKDN","title":"Dharam Sankat Mein","productDescription":"","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/k/d/n/dharam-sankat-mein-200x200-imae9de5vdszshgs.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/k/d/n/dharam-sankat-mein-400x400-imae9de5vdszshgs.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/k/d/n/dharam-sankat-mein-800x800-imae9de5vdszshgs.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/k/d/n/dharam-sankat-mein-original-imae9de5vdszshgs.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[AVME9CGYZFP5DKDN]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":299.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":149.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":149.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/dharam-sankat-mein/p/itme9cgfcwaqagbj?pid=AVME9CGYZFP5DKDN&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":50.0,"offers":["10% Instant Discount* with Axis Bank Cards","10% Instant Discount* with StanChart Cards"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":70.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Sat Sep 10 23:59:59 IST 2016 - Sun Sep 11 23:59:59 IST 2016 days.","sellerName":"VIDEOJUNCTION","sellerAverageRating":4.0851064,"sellerNoOfRatings":94,"sellerNoOfReviews":2},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Shemaroo Entertainment"]},{"key":"Title","value":["Dharam Sankat Mein"]},{"key":"Format","value":["DVD"]},{"key":"Language","value":["Hindi"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]},{"key":"Rating","value":["UA"]}]},{"key":"Disc Features","values":[{"key":"Total Number of Discs","value":["1"]},{"key":"Video Encoding","value":["All Regions"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"Hindi","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Shemaroo Entertainment","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMD9P46QPZJPUYP","title":"Crazy Mohan's Chocolate Krishna","productDescription":"Everyday, we humans constantly wish for many things in our prayers. However, how many of these greedy needs do you think God would want to grant? Crazy Mohan's Chocolate Krishna is a Tamil comedy-drama play that follows the life of a struggling salesman named Maadhu who works in a chocolate company and is a sincere devotee of Lord Krishna. Seeing Maadhu and his family’s misfortune, Krishna decides to descend from the heavens to fulfill their desires. However, Krishna soon finds out that a human being isn’t easily satisfied. This successful play has been performed more than 500 times since its inception. Hence, it can be clearly determined that this play is hysterically hilarious and a must-see.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/u/y/p/crazy-mohan-s-chocolate-krishna-200x200-imada3f7bjrkhdna.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/u/y/p/crazy-mohan-s-chocolate-krishna-400x400-imada3f7bjrkhdna.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/u/y/p/crazy-mohan-s-chocolate-krishna-800x800-imada3f7bjrkhdna.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/u/y/p/crazy-mohan-s-chocolate-krishna-original-imada3f7bjrkhdna.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[AVMD9P46QPZJPUYP]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":350.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":350.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":280.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/crazy-mohan-s-chocolate-krishna/p/itmd9p48zjfwakyz?pid=AVMD9P46QPZJPUYP&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0.0,"offers":["Extra 20% off on selected products","10% Instant Discount* with Axis Bank Cards","10% Instant Discount* with StanChart Cards"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":50.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Sat Sep 10 23:59:59 IST 2016 - Sun Sep 11 23:59:59 IST 2016 days.","sellerName":"Kalakendra","sellerAverageRating":4.3289475,"sellerNoOfRatings":76,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Moserbear"]},{"key":"Title","value":["Crazy Mohan's Chocolate Krishna"]},{"key":"Format","value":["DVD"]},{"key":"Language","value":["Tamil"]},{"key":"Year of Release","value":["2012"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]},{"key":"Main Cast","value":["S.B.

While the first three films were about Jason Bourne, the 4th installment of the highly popular franchise introduces a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films. The Bourne Identity A man (Matt Damon) is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea with two gunshot wounds in his back and a device with the number of a Swiss safe deposit box embedded in his hip. Upon reaching shore, the man assumes the name Jason Bourne after finding a passport under the name in the safe deposit box, along with other international passports, large amounts of assorted currencies, and a gun. He subsequently attempts to discover his true identity while countering attempts on his life by CIA assassins, eventually realizing that he is one such assassin who failed to complete his most recent mission. Bourne breaks his connections to the CIA and unites with Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), a woman who helped him learn about his most recent actions prior to his memory loss. Bourne's conflict with the CIA reaches a climax when he takes the fight to their doorstep. The Bourne Supremacy Some two years after learning that he is a trained assassin and breaking his connections with the CIA, Jason Bourne is framed for a crime connected to one of his past missions. A subsequent attempt on his life results in Marie's death, so he decides to take revenge by hunting down those responsible for her death and his forgotten past, thinking that the CIA is hunting him again. Bourne discovers that Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), one of the men who oversaw Operation Treadstone, the program which trained Bourne to be an assassin, stole millions of dollars from the CIA. Abbott meant to implicate Bourne in the theft with the frameup, which would have led the CIA on a wild goose chase had Bourne been killed as intended. Bourne exposes Abbott to Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), the CIA agent in charge of finding Bourne, and Abbott commits suicide. During a long car chase with Bourne, the Russian agent who was paid to kill him and was responsible for Marie's death is killed, and Bourne goes into hiding. The Bourne Ultimatum Six weeks later, Bourne learns that a British journalist has been investigating his past and contacts him to find out who his source is. Bourne is subsequently targeted by Operation Blackbriar, an upgraded Operation Treadstone, which has also taken note of the investigation. Believing that Bourne is a threat and is seeking revenge, Blackbriar's director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) begins a new hunt for Bourne. Bourne manages to take classified documents proving that Blackbriar has targeted U.S. citizens and is aided by Landy, who disagreed with Vosen from the beginning and does not support Blackbriar's existence, and former Treadstone logistics technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), whom, it is implied, had some romantic feelings for Bourne before his final mission and resultant amnesia. Bourne finally comes face to face with the person who oversaw his behavioral modification as the first Treadstone operative some years earlier, memories of which resurface. Those responsible for Treadstone and Blackbriar are exposed, and Bourne goes underground. The Bourne Legacy Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is a member of Operation Outcome, a United States Department of Defense black ops program which enhances the physical and mental abilities of field operatives through pills referred to as \"chems\". Cross is deployed to Alaska for a training assignment, crosses rugged terrain to reach a cabin operated by an exiled Outcome operative. The Blackbriar and Treadstone programs are publicly exposed, leading the FBI and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate those involved. Retired Air Force Colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton), who is responsible for overseeing the CIA's clandestine operations, decides to end Outcome and kill its agents.

Leonetti-directed, nail-biting spin-off of and prequel to the critically acclaimed 2013 film, The Conjuring, Annabelle is a horror film that stars Annabelle Wallis of Pan Am fame, Ward Horton and 4-time Emmy Award-winner Alfre Woodard.

EXPERIENCE THE ONENESS WITH MUSIC DVD Standard Edition","productDescription":"One - Experience Oneness With Music - DVD T.M. Krishna When nothing comes between the art and artiste There was no performance. There was no reality to suspend. There were no expectations to fulfill. The artiste sang to experience sheer joy. Nothing came between the art and artiste, we tried to capture it as unobtrusively as possible to preserve the purity of the moment.When nature inspires an artistes imagination Far away from the world of traditions and expectations, a voice searches for those perfect notes and beautiful phrases that define his music. The artiste's imagination is set free by the birds and the breeze, the rivers and the mountains.When music stops being a performance art In the confines of the auditorium, limited by expectations, an artiste takes the stage not purely to embrace music but to also satisfy varied expectations. In this environment, often the artiste and the listener are unable to suspend the reality around them to experience the sheer joy of being one with the music.Evolution of Carnatic music and the road to OneThe term Carnatic music, in a geographical sense, refers to South Indian classical music'. But this would be a limited way of considering a tradition of composing and practicing an orally and textually grounded musical form, both vocal and instrumental, known for its overpowering musical abstraction. Its aesthetic fabric is woven by the confluence of Raga’ (Sanskrit for a melodic idea similar to a mode), ‘Tala' (Sanskrit for structured rhythmic cycles in musical time) and a text. These three elements come together to create spectacular aural patterns. Its presentation allows for the composed musical forms to combine into a solo exposition in which the individual musician can – and, in fact, must – improvise with imagination and skill. The antiquity of this musical tradition — dated to five hundred years – has been on an inner and outward journey for that many or even more centuries. Over time, a continued tradition of musicianship and scholarship has allowed the music to adapt to the ever-changing socio-political environment. In the early 20th century, the practice of the art moved from temples and royal precincts to the urban concert stage","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/music/c/a/y/standard-edition-one-experience-the-oneness-with-music-dvd-200x200-imaeh49nxrnmwqzd.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/music/c/a/y/standard-edition-one-experience-the-oneness-with-music-dvd-400x400-imaeh49nxrnmwqzd.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/music/c/a/y/standard-edition-one-experience-the-oneness-with-music-dvd-800x800-imaeh49nxrnmwqzd.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/music/c/a/y/standard-edition-one-experience-the-oneness-with-music-dvd-original-imaeh49nxrnmwqzd.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[MSIEG2KAXATZFCAY]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":1250.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":1250.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":1250.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/one-experience-oneness-music-dvd-standard/p/itmeg2kavkhrg4es?pid=MSIEG2KAXATZFCAY&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0.0,"offers":[],"categoryPath":"Home Furnishing>Audio CD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Tue Aug 30 23:59:59 IST 2016 -

Directed by Edward Zwick, The Last Samurai is an American action-drama film that stars 3-time Golden Globe Award-winner Tom Cruise of Mission Impossible fame, Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada. Set in 19th-century Japan, the storyline of this captivating flick follows an American military advisor, who, after being captured by the Japanese opposition, eventually uncovers the beauty in the Samurai’s way of life and begins to contemplate about which side he should fight for. From the genius of director Wolfgang Petersen, a 2-time Academy Award-nominee, stems another compelling tale of epic proportions - Troy. Starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger, Troy is a war-adventure film that’s based on Homer’s Iliad. Set in the year 1193 B.C., Troy follows Paris, the Prince of Troy, who kidnaps Helen, the Queen of Sparta, because he is deeply in love with her. This sets off a tragic war between the two kingdoms, one that forebodes utter bloodshed.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/q/f/y/the-last-samurai-troy-200x200-imadws4hqhfugrcr.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/q/f/y/the-last-samurai-troy-400x400-imadws4hqhfugrcr.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/q/f/y/the-last-samurai-troy-800x800-imadws4hqhfugrcr.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/q/f/y/the-last-samurai-troy-original-imadws4hqhfugrcr.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[AVMDWR97T2JTMQFY]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":799.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":799.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":799.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/last-samurai-troy/p/itmdwr9ghxdwngng?pid=AVMDWR97T2JTMQFY&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0.0,"offers":["10% Instant Discount* with Axis Bank Cards","10% Instant Discount* with StanChart Cards"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"WS Retail","sellerAverageRating":4.2291837,"sellerNoOfRatings":5820203,"sellerNoOfReviews":179038},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Sony DADC"]},{"key":"Title","value":["The Last Samurai & Troy"]},{"key":"Format","value":["DVD"]},{"key":"Language","value":["English"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]}]},{"key":"Contributors","values":[{"key":"Studio","value":["Warner Bros"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"English","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"Sony DADC","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMEE4SZ7WZKXXRR","title":"Tamasha : DVD","productDescription":"","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/x/r/r/tamasha-dvd-200x200-imaeepushy5jcqsc.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/x/r/r/tamasha-dvd-400x400-imaeepushy5jcqsc.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/x/r/r/tamasha-dvd-800x800-imaeepushy5jcqsc.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/x/r/r/tamasha-dvd-original-imaeepushy5jcqsc.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[AVMEE4SZ7WZKXXRR]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":399.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":349.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":349.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/tamasha-dvd/p/itmee4szvhfyezpt?pid=AVMEE4SZ7WZKXXRR&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":12.0,"offers":["Extra 15% off* with digibank by DBS"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Thu Sep 01 23:59:59 IST 2016 - Fri Sep 02 23:59:59 IST 2016 days.","sellerName":"RELIANCE","sellerAverageRating":3.7212477,"sellerNoOfRatings":513,"sellerNoOfReviews":33},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Reliance Big Entertainment Pvt.

Still dealing with the haunting trauma of losing his loved ones, Ajay manages to make a credible name for himself in investigative journalism. Working with a strange team of RTI activists, ex-criminals and ilk; and even stranger ways of unearthing & presenting truth, Ajay Mehra has earned quite a fan following among the youths, who finds his fearless & unforgiving approach in dealing with all kinds of sociopaths very inspiring.Among his die hard fans are these four teenagers who happened to have received bravery medals from him once. These four friends once out on photography expedition, accidentally record a murder on a camera. The footage turns out to be explosive as it clearly shows two of the city’s most powerful peoples (an industrialist and a minister) involved in the murder of a RTI activist associated with Satyakam. Amidst family pressure they hands over the footage to a corporate lawyer (father of one of them) expecting him to bring the mighty sociopaths to justice. The lawyer instead strikes a deal with the mighty ones.When the kids get to know of this, feel betrayed. Luckily they had a backup copy of that footage with them. Unaware of the fact that they were all now under the scanner of that powerful industrialist’s surveillance army, they call up Ajay Mehra informing him about the murder & their wish to give that footage to him. The surveillance engineers intercept this call and the industrialist unleashes all his power to stop the kids from reaching Ajay Mehra. The minister too gets involved in the preventive attacks by paralyzing Ajay Mehra’s media network through simultaneous raids by various government agencies.Owing to their immense control over the media and government machinery, the evil duo manages to portray Ajay Mehra and the four kids as the enemy of the state on the run- within a span of just few hours. As if it was not enough Ajay Mehra is left to deal with the families of the four kids too, who feel that Ajay has instigated their kids to land up in a dangerous predicament like that. The matters get even worse when the psychological demons of his traumatic past come alive before him, revealing a truth that blows his senses away. Amidst these hostilities, fighting with people who literally own the world he was in, Ajay rises to fight back with power that only an injured tiger (Ghayal Sher) of the legends possess.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/6/s/m/ghayal-once-again-2016-hindi-dvd-reliance-big-entertainment-pvt-200x200-imaeguryp6qr2yrb.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/6/s/m/ghayal-once-again-2016-hindi-dvd-reliance-big-entertainment-pvt-400x400-imaeguryp6qr2yrb.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/6/s/m/ghayal-once-again-2016-hindi-dvd-reliance-big-entertainment-pvt-800x800-imaeguryp6qr2yrb.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/6/s/m/ghayal-once-again-2016-hindi-dvd-reliance-big-entertainment-pvt-original-imaeguryp6qr2yrb.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[MIEEGW3BJVGWR6SM]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":299.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":253.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":253.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/ghayal-once-again/p/itmegw3bgfykzakk?pid=MIEEGW3BJVGWR6SM&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":15.0,"offers":["Extra 15% off* with digibank by DBS"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Sat Sep 10 23:59:59 IST 2016 - Sun Sep 11 23:59:59 IST 2016 days.","sellerName":"RELIANCE","sellerAverageRating":3.726923,"sellerNoOfRatings":520,"sellerNoOfReviews":33},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Reliance Big Entertainment Pvt.

Instead he languished in a nightmare for a decade: his gloves were spiked during an all important match, blinding him in the arena, and handing the match to his undeserving opponent—a mediocre boxer but a political powerhouse. The culprit was his own coach, Dev Khatri.Shattered by his loss, and disillusioned by the state of Indian boxing, Adi turned to a life of cynical self-destruction: booze, brothels and bar-fights. Until loyal friends somehow bring him back to boxing, this time as the coach of the lowly rated Indian women’s boxing team. His outspoken honesty sends jitters through his old adversaries, and he is soon transferred to Chennai—the Siberia of Indian boxing. But Adi continues to dream: this time for a free-spirited, fiery young woman from the fishing community: Madhi. She has no training, but tons of raw talent. Adi spots in her a champion that could bring India the gold that he was robbed off. All he needs is to train her… But that is the last thing she wants. She loves to pick fights outside the arena, but has no interest in entering it. Having seen her elder sister’s struggles in the field of women’s boxing she is viscerally averse to it. That world is synonymous for her with nepotism, with lascivious men with no interest in boxing and all interest in exploiting the needy female boxers. Adi must first earn her trust, then tame her impetuosity, and finally make her dream… all this in just nine months before the world championship. And so begins an uneasy partnership between a man who loves his sport and a girl who loves her freedom. Rigor and rebellion, structure and free spirit collide. It is the beginning of a beautiful friendship… and a journey towards an impossible dream.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/n/2/d/salaa-khadoos-2016-hindi-dvd-reliance-big-entertainment-pvt-ltd-200x200-imaegur3y7bhkezf.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/n/2/d/salaa-khadoos-2016-hindi-dvd-reliance-big-entertainment-pvt-ltd-400x400-imaegur3y7bhkezf.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/n/2/d/salaa-khadoos-2016-hindi-dvd-reliance-big-entertainment-pvt-ltd-800x800-imaegur3y7bhkezf.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/n/2/d/salaa-khadoos-2016-hindi-dvd-reliance-big-entertainment-pvt-ltd-original-imaegur3y7bhkezf.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[MIEEGW3BTUHUFN2D]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":299.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":254.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":203.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/salaa-khadoos/p/itmegw3bdeyjdpqp?pid=MIEEGW3BTUHUFN2D&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":15.0,"offers":["Extra 20% off on selected products","10% Instant Discount* with Axis Bank Cards","10% Instant Discount* with StanChart Cards"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Sat Sep 10 23:59:59 IST 2016 - Sun Sep 11 23:59:59 IST 2016 days.","sellerName":"RELIANCE","sellerAverageRating":3.726923,"sellerNoOfRatings":520,"sellerNoOfReviews":33},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Reliance Big Entertainment Pvt.

In his quest for supremacy, Khan Sahab loses his friend Panditji and many more things that even his Royal Singer title, a huge mansion and riches cannot bring back.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/e/n/u/katyar-kaljat-ghusali-2016-marathi-dvd-video-palace-200x200-imaejfqjb7bxchz7.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/e/n/u/katyar-kaljat-ghusali-2016-marathi-dvd-video-palace-400x400-imaejfqjb7bxchz7.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/e/n/u/katyar-kaljat-ghusali-2016-marathi-dvd-video-palace-800x800-imaejfqjb7bxchz7.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/movie/e/n/u/katyar-kaljat-ghusali-2016-marathi-dvd-video-palace-original-imaejfqjb7bxchz7.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[MIEEJVMXVFVCCENU]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":349.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":349.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":349.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/katyar-kaljat-ghusali/p/itmejvmxudmctsm5?pid=MIEEJVMXVFVCCENU&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0.0,"offers":[],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":65.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Sun Aug 21 23:59:59 IST 2016 - Mon Aug 22 23:59:59 IST 2016 days.","sellerName":"PRAVINTRADINGCO","sellerAverageRating":4.25,"sellerNoOfRatings":92,"sellerNoOfReviews":3},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["VIDEO PALACE"]},{"key":"Title","value":["Katyar Kaljat Ghusali"]},{"key":"Format","value":["DVD"]},{"key":"Language","value":["Marathi"]},{"key":"Year of Release","value":["2016"]},{"key":"Genre","value":["Drama"]},{"key":"Main Cast","value":["Sachin Pilgaonkar Shankar Mahadevan Subodh Bhave Amruta Khanvilkar Mrunmayee Deshpande Sakshi Tanwar"]},{"key":"Director","value":["SUBOD BHAVE"]},{"key":"Rating","value":["U"]}]},{"key":"Disc Features","values":[{"key":"Total Running Time","value":["171"]},{"key":"Total Number of Discs","value":["2"]},{"key":"Aspect Ratio","value":["16:9 (Widescreen)"]},{"key":"Subtitle Languages","value":["ENGLISH"]}]},{"key":"Contributors","values":[{"key":"Studio","value":["VIDEO PALACE"]}]}],"booksInfo":{"language":"Marathi","binding":null,"pages":null,"publisher":"VIDEO PALACE","year":0,"authors":[]},"lifeStyleInfo":{"sleeve":null,"neck":null,"idealFor":null}}},{"productBaseInfoV1":{"productId":"AVMEDWRVFQZVWAGG","title":"Court","productDescription":"","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/a/g/g/court-200x200-imaedwsffyntyzdm.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/a/g/g/court-400x400-imaedwsffyntyzdm.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/a/g/g/court-800x800-imaedwsffyntyzdm.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/av-media/movies/a/g/g/court-original-imaedwsffyntyzdm.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[AVMEDWRVFQZVWAGG]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":299.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":269.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":215.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/court/p/itmedwrvbaqsgrha?pid=AVMEDWRVFQZVWAGG&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":23.0,"offers":["Extra 20% off on selected products","10% Instant Discount* with Axis Bank Cards","10% Instant Discount* with StanChart Cards"],"categoryPath":"Movies & TV Show>Movies>DVD","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":65.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Sat Sep 10 23:59:59 IST 2016 - Sun Sep 11 23:59:59 IST 2016 days.","sellerName":"RELIANCE","sellerAverageRating":3.726923,"sellerNoOfRatings":520,"sellerNoOfReviews":33},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":[],"detailedSpecs":[],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Publisher","value":["Reliance Big Entertainment Pvt.

Not much bothers Munna. Except his parent's annual visit from the village. Munna's father, Hari Prasad Sharma, an upright, moralistic man believes that his son is actually a doctor running a charity hospital. Each year, when his parents arrive, Munna and his gang bathe, shave, don white coats and stethoscopes and pretend to be diligent doctors. This year, the clever charade falls apart. Sharma runs into an old friend, Dr Asthana who has a daughter called Suman. The two decide that their children, both doctors, would make the perfect match. Munna tries hard to get out of the situation but Dr Asthana discovers the truth and humiliates Munna in front of his father. Broken by the truth and ashamed of his son, Hari Prasad Sharma removes his spotless white turban and cries. Munnabhai then takes a decision that will change many lives; he decides to become a doctor. And then begins a hilarious and heartwarming journey of a local goon into the medical world – a world in which he neither belongs nor believes in.
