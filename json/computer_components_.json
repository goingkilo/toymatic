That's why outfitting your Mac with a Corcair Mac Memory upgrade kit is one of the best things you can do to maximize your system's performance and ability. With a Mac that's been upgraded to the maximum amount of memory it supports, you'll spend less time waiting for your applications to buffer data to the hard drive, and more time working or playing.
