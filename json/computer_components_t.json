Often you will have to duck beneath your desk to reach for an available outlet. PowerCube |Extended| versions come with a unique docking system, enabling you to mount the PowerCube on your desk or underneath it so that you can charge your notebook and smartphone right from your desktop.Removable tapeThe docking station that comes with PowerCube |Extended| versions can be mounted with the two pieces of tape provided. Whenever you decide to remove it, simply pull the tabs. We carefully selected the sticky tape to be as powerful as possible, and yet leave no traces on the surface when removed.Duo-chargingIn the bedroom you might want to read an eBook, work with your tablet computer, and/or play with your smartphone. However, their USB cables are often too short to reach your bed. By placing a PowerCube |Extended USB| next to your bed, you can charge your devices via its high-powered dual USB ports (2.1A) that allow charging two devices simultaneously. The charging time will be shorter than charging via a USB port on your notebook. Now you do not need to worry about running out of battery, as power is available right at your bedside.No blockageThe world would be a better, more efficient place, if the devices we use had compact plugs.

Being non-curing and electrically non-conductive, it is safe for use too. This CPU thermal compound is efficient as a result of its heat dissipation properties. Its grease-like texture helps the CPU or GPU to achieve constant cooling as a result of the heat dissipation, thus ensuring their safety. Weighing just 32g, it is also light in weight and is handy for use. This particular piece comes in white. Easy to Apply and Non-Corrosive: The IC Value V1 thermal compound comes in a syringe form, which allows for easy application. Once ready, it simply needs to be pointed at the desired spot and used exactly like a syringe to apply the compound and begin the cooling process. This thermal compound has traits such as being non-corrosive, non-capacitive in addition to being low in thermal resistance but high on thermal conductivity. The Cooler Master thermal compound prevents corrosion once used in the desired areas. This enables your CPU, GPU or other applications to be kept cool for safety.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/thermal-paste/5/7/n/rg-icv1-tw20-r1-cooler-master-200x200-imaejyybu5zzmxhv.jpeg","400x400":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/thermal-paste/5/7/n/rg-icv1-tw20-r1-cooler-master-400x400-imaejyybu5zzmxhv.jpeg","800x800":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/thermal-paste/5/7/n/rg-icv1-tw20-r1-cooler-master-800x800-imaejyybu5zzmxhv.jpeg","unknown":"http://img.fkcdn.com/image/thermal-paste/5/7/n/rg-icv1-tw20-r1-cooler-master-original-imaejyybu5zzmxhv.jpeg"},"productFamily":["[TRPE2GQWZEZRU57N]"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":350.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":299.0,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":299.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/cooler-master-ic-ceramic-based-thermal-paste/p/itme2gqwcmrmpgbh?pid=TRPE2GQWZEZRU57N&affid=goingkilo","productBrand":"Cooler Master","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":1.0,"offers":[],"categoryPath":"Computers>Computer Components>Thermal Pastes","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":60.0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in Tue Sep 13 23:59:59 IST 2016 -
