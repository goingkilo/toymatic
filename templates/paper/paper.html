                        When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again - <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Steve Jobs</span>

                        Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all.”

                    Always works in small teams.
                <p>
                    Keep a low profile. Never deal with anyone who doesn't come recommended.
                <p>
                    I mean it's like selling anything: washing machines, hand made rugs, blow jobs, as long as you don't take the piss people will always come back for more.
                <p>
                    And that's not to say that we don't have that special kind of magic that turns two kilos into three. But never get too greedy.
                <p>
                    Know and respect your enemy! It is only very very stupid people who think the law is stupid.
                <p>
                    And avoid like the plague, loud attention seeking wannabe gangsters who are in it for the glory, to be a face, to be a name. They don't mean to fuck up.
                <p>
                    They just do. Oh, and forgive me for stating the obvious, but stay away from the end user.
